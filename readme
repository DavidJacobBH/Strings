In fulfillment of the requirement from section 2.4.6 of the Academic
Regulations in Princeton's Rights, Rules, Responsibilities guide,
and the COS 217 Generative AI policy, disclose and describe how you
used AI in completing this assignment:

I used AI (ChatGPT) to clarify the differences between array and pointer notation
and how they apply to the string functions.

I used AI (ChatGPT) understand how Str_search and Str_compare should operate before implementing my
own version of them.

I used AI (ChatGPT) to understand split warnings and how to resolve them,

I used AI (ChatGPT) understand the intended behavior of replaceAndWrite and how to
stream output safely without allocating large buffers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

It was a tiny bit confusing at times but overall it was a good assignment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

I was recommended by AI to change how Str_compare should work in that it should
use the strcmp difference instead of returning -1, 0, or 1. I did not
implement this change because nowhere in the places I looked for the behaviour of
did I find this specification.

What warnings does splint generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

No unless the capacity is passed in as an argument, which is not the case
in the current implementation. This is because pcDest is just a pointer and
there is no way to know how much memory it points to.
